# POKER MONROY

Every 15 days my family reunites on friday to play poker. It's a tradition that have lasted more than 10 years now, so we have a very long history of scores, champions and money gained.

My intention with this app is to have a source for reference and consult of previous games and table positions.

I will code sections for checking previous games, by player, host home, day, month or year. Another section for register participants and for create the events.

My goal is to have this finished by the first days of July, 2018.
